# Machine Learning Practice Repository

This repository contains my hands-on practice work in Machine Learning.
The focus is on understanding concepts clearly by implementing models,
working with real datasets, and analyzing results instead of just theory.

This repo is meant for learning, experimentation, and steady improvement.
